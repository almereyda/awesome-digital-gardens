## Favorites from around the web
_In no particular order:_

- [Tom Critchlow's Wiki](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki)  -  aka a digital garden aka a hypertext. Organized into well defined categories.
- [Maggie Appleton's Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) - an open collection of notes, resources, sketches, and explorations.
- [Neil's Digital Garden](https://commonplace.doubleloop.net/) - or is it a commonplace book? Perhaps it's really a personal wiki, or an exobrain. Let's just use Neil's own term: it's a _hyper commonplace garden wiki_.
- [Andy Matuschak's Working Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) - the man, the myth, the legend, the digital garden every other digital gardener has been inspired by.
- [Ian Jones's Digital Garden](https://www.ianjones.us/digital-garden) - the layer between Jones's raw notes and the essays he publishes.
- [Brendan Schlagel's Personal Canon](https://www.brendanschlagel.com/canon/) - not really a digital garden, but a collection of books, music, art, science, and other sundries that they keep returning to.
- [Enjoyment Work](https://enjoyment-work.netlify.app/) ([repo here](https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work)) - this digital garden is packed with stuff, has extremely Brutalist web vibes and I love it. Created by [Brennan Brown](https://github.com/brennanbrown) as a catalog of his notes, a daily progress journal, and a blog (_"...the final step for process of smart note-taking."_
